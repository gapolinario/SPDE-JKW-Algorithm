# TODO

1. Dealiasing
2. Other analytical tests (Kloeden Platen p. 118)
3. Understand difference IF and ETD, Higher order

# SIMULATIONS

0: JKW, alpha=0, dt=2 dx^2, works
1: Euler-Maruyama, alpha=0, dt=2 dx^2, works
2: JKW, alpha=0.1, dt=2 dx^2, seems to work?
3:
4: JKW, alpha=0.1, dt=2 dx^2, big parameters, works very well
